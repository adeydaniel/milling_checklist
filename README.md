# Milling Machine Checklist

> DISCLAIMER: I am a beginner at operating machines. This is my attempt to distill the various operations I am learning into organized checklists as I learn them. By all means, this checklist is NOT to be presumed accurate, safe to use, or best practice. *Use at your own risk!!!*

##Safety Reminders
- Check self for proper attire such as safety glasses, no loose clothing, cords, rings, watches, hair, etc.
- _Unplug the machine_.
- Clear the worktable of non-essential parts.

##Finding the Origin of a Workpiece

- Take the necessary [safety measures](#safety-reminders) as detailed in the Milling Machine Safety Guidelines.
- Check the levelness of the fixed jaw of the vise with an indicator.
- Install the drill chuck on the spindle using a collet of the appropriate size.
- Put an edge finder in the drill chuck and tighten with the chuck key. *Remember to remove the chuck key immediately after tightening*.
- Brush off chips from vise and parrallels. A small chip can throw off the position of the workpiece.
- After moving the saddle to a position that makes access to the vise easy, place the workpiece or the 1-2-3 block on top of the parrallels in the vise (the paralles should be held in place with a spring). The forefinger and thumb should be used to press the piece against the fixed vise jaw and the stopper while tightening the vise lever with a wrench. Further tightening the vise jaw with two hands on the lever.
- Plug the machine into the power outlet.
- If the origin is in the top left corner, the 1-2-3 block can be used. Otherwise, use the workpiece being worked on.
-  To find the edge in the x-axis, position the end of the edge finder 1/8'' below the top surface of the workpiece and slights to the left of it. 
-  Check that the high/neutral/low lever is set to high then turn on the spindle. Now, the spindle speed can be ajusted to 1000 rpm using the speed change handwheel. *The spindle must be spinning before the spindle speed is set.*
-  Slowly move the table on the x-axis towards the off-center spinning edge finder until the spinning becomes concentric. Move further just until bottom cylinder falls out of alignment. Stop and turn off the spindle. Zero the readout and the dial on the table crank.
-  Lift the quill up and move the table in the same direction as before by the radius of the edge finder. Now, this is the zero of the x-axis. Repeat the zeroing of the readout and the dial on the table crank. 
- To find the zero point on the y-axis, the above steps can be repeated with the exception that the spinning edge finder approaches the vise surface.
