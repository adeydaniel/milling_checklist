# Milling Machine Checklist

> DISCLAIMER: I am a beginner at operating machines. This is my attempt to distill the various operations I am learning into organized checklists as I learn them. By all means, this checklist is NOT to be presumed accurate, safe to use, or best practice. *Use at your own risk!!!*

## Safety Reminders
- Check self for proper attire such as safety glasses, no loose clothing, cords, rings, watches, unrestrained hair, etc.
- _Unplug the machine_.
- Clear the worktable of non-essential parts.

## Cutting a Piece to Specification
- Go over [safety measures](#safety-reminders).
- Use indicator to check levelness of fixed vise jaw.
- Make certain the vise is free of chips.
- Move saddle out and secure parallels with a spring.
- Place in workpiece, hold with thumb and forefinger while tighening vise. Thighten more with two hands (*Moving the handle toward self starting from ~ 135 degrees results in the maximum force with the least effort.*)
- Fit an endmill in the spindle with the appropriate collet.
- While the mill is still off, get workpiece close. Turn on the spindle - the direction of spin must be clockwise and the tip of the endmill should be below the bottom surface of the piece - and bring workpiece in slight contact with the endmill.  
- Face off a thin layer. The baseline dimension will be taken from this point.
- Zero both the digital readout and the wheel dial reading.
- Measure the workpiece from the newly faced surface to the opposite edge with a caliper while the it remains in the vise (In this instance, its other edge had already been squared).
- Lubricate the tool and workpiece with oil.
- Execute roughing cuts of no more than half the diameter of the endmill until about within 0.020 inches of the desired dimension.
- Take the final cuts in small increments to approach 0.005 above the final dimension. A second or third pass of the endmill at the same setting will remove 0.001 to 0.002 inches to get the length to within the specified tolerance.


## Finding the Origin of a Workpiece

- Take the necessary [safety measures](#safety-reminders) as detailed in the Milling Machine Safety Guidelines.
- Check the levelness of the fixed jaw of the vise with an indicator.
- Install the drill chuck on the spindle using a collet of the appropriate size.
- Put an edge finder in the drill chuck and tighten with the chuck key. *Remember to remove the chuck key immediately after tightening*.
- Brush off chips from vise and parrallels. A small chip can throw off the position of the workpiece.
- After moving the saddle to a position that makes access to the vise easy, place the workpiece or the 1-2-3 block on top of the parrallels in the vise (the paralles should be held in place with a spring). The forefinger and thumb should be used to press the piece against the fixed vise jaw and the stopper while tightening the vise lever with a wrench. Further tighten the vise jaw with two hands on the lever.
- Plug the machine into the power outlet.
- If the origin is in the top left corner, the 1-2-3 block can be used. Otherwise, use the workpiece being worked on.
-  To find the edge in the x-axis, position the end of the edge finder 1/8'' below the top surface of the workpiece and slights to the left of it. 
-  Check that the high/neutral/low lever is set to high then turn on the spindle. Now, the spindle speed can be ajusted to 1000 rpm using the speed change handwheel. *The spindle must be spinning before the spindle speed is set.*
-  Slowly move the table on the x-axis towards the off-center spinning edge finder until the spinning becomes concentric. Move further just until bottom cylinder falls out of alignment. Stop and turn off the spindle. Zero the readout and the dial on the table crank.
-  Lift the quill and move the table in the same direction as before by the radius of the edge finder (*diameter should be checked with a caliper*). Now, this is the zero of the x-axis. Repeat the zeroing of the digital readout and the dial on the table crank. 
- To find the zero point on the y-axis, the above steps can be repeated with the exception that the spinning edge finder approaches the vise surface. 

## How to Remove and Load the Drill Chuck onto the Milling Machine
- Removing
	- Unplug machine.
	- Raise the quill to expose the drawbar above the head of the machine.
	- while holding down the brake, turn the drawbar with a wrench a full turn, then loosen with fingers three whole turns.
	- With one hand holding on to the tool held in the drill chuck, give the top of the drawbar a firm hit with the wrench to release the tool and drill chuck.
- Loading
	- Unplug machine.
	- Fit the drill chuck within a collet of the appropriate size, then place the collet and drill chuck pair into the spindle opening. 
	- With one hand holding on on to the pair, tighten the drawbar by hand with the other. Once a grip is established, the drawbar must be further tightened with a wrench. *A small space should be left between the top of the drill chuck and the spindle*. 

## Projects

### Helper for milling project mill-117
- Secure piece in mill vise so that the end of the piece is sticking out 3/8'' with datum A against the fixed jaw and datum B on the parallels.
- Mill a small amount from the end and deburr.
- Mill the other end to ~ 2 thousandth of an inch over 3 inches and debur.
- Scribe on the front surface.
- Touch tool to top of piece and zero on the knee micrometer.
- Raise the table by 0.250'' in steps and cut from the right edge to 1/32'' of datum F. Take measuremnts and cut to F in increments.
- Set the x-axis to zero. This will be the reference point to cut to datum G.
- Raise the table 0.300'' more and mill from the right edge to datum G in increments. Make use of the zero set at datum F to mill to G (0.500'').
- Bring endmill to the middle between datum D and E. There should be be about 1/6'' of clearance on both sides. Mill to datum D first, then to E leaving a slot of 0.563'' +/- 0.005.
